# Chirpy

A backend Twitter clone, built as an exercise to learn Go API development.

## Running the project

1. Clone the repo locally. Note that this was created with go v1.21.4
2. From the root folder, run `go build` to build the project.
3. Run the produced binary; e.g.: `go build -o out && ./out`. Note that there is an optional `--debug` flag for the binary that will delete any existing database file for clean testing.
